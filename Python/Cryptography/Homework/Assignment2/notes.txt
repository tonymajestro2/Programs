1. The following was encrypted by the Vigenere method. Decrypt it. Carefully 
document your work â€“ in general, more details are better than fewer details.

Since we're given the cipher, we know the system is polyalphabetic.  This means
that we don't have to calculate the Index of Coincidence for the ciphertext to
determine that it is in fact a polyalphabetic system.

The next step is to try to determine the key-length of the cipher.  The method
I chose was the kasiski method.  The following algorithm attempts to calculate the 
key length for a given ciphertext.

(kasiski method code)

We've determined that the key length is 5.  Since 5 is prime, it must be the
actual key length and not a multiple of the key length.

Now that we have the key length, we can separate our ciphertext into lengths
of 5.  When we stack each row of ciphertexts, we can perform frequency analysis 
on each column of the stack.  This is because each column was encrypted using
the same letter.  The following program shows the letter frequencies for
each column:

As a sanity check, we can check the Index of Coincidence for each column. Each
column should have an IC of around 0.066.





2. Suppose you have a language with only the three letters a, b, c, and they occur 
with frequencies 0.7, 0.2 and 0.1, respectively. The following ciphertext was 
encrypted by the Vigenere method (shifts are mod 3 instead of mod 26):

ABCBABBBAC

You are told that the key length is 1, 2, or 3. Show that the key length is 
probably 2, and determine the most probable key. Again, document your work.

To determine the key length, we can begin by calculating the Index of
Coincidence of the language:

(Show IC for language)

Next, to determine the key length, we can construct stacks of rows of length
m = 1,2,3 and determine the IC of each column.  The value of m that gives
ICs closest to the IC for the language is likely the key length.
