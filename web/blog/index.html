            <h2>New HTML 5 elements</h2>
            <p>When I began brainstorming ideas for a second blog post, I thought about how I could separate blog posts on the page.  I could just use a &ltdiv&gt to separate posts, but I figured there might be an HTML element to separate parts of a page that are supposed to be grouped together.  I looked around on some wordpress blogs and came across a few elements new to HTML5 that are handy.</p>

            <p>The first element is the &ltarticle&gt element. From the W3 HTML5 spec:<p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p>The article element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site and that is, in principle, independently distributable or reusable, e.g. in syndication. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>This is actually the exact type of element I needed to separate blog entries on the page.  It will also be helpful for adding style rules to separate each blog post. After looking through some of the other elements new to HTML5, I found the &ltheader&gt and &ltfooter&gt elements.  The W3 HTML5 spec documents their use:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p>The header element represents a group of introductory or navigational aids.<br />
                A header element is intended to usually contain the section's heading (an h1 - h6 element or an hgroup element), but this is not required. The header element can also be used to wrap a section's table of contents, a search form, or any relevant logos.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The footer element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about its section such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data, and the like.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>The header and footer elements also appear to be useful, but I have not yet incorporated them into the blog yet.</p>

        <article id="entry1">
            <h2>First entry</h2>
            <p>This is my first entry in my blog project. I plan on documenting each step of the development process of the blog.  Currently, the blog only contains basic HTML.  I hope to add more markup to the blog and add some style using CSS.</p>
    
            <p>Once the site is more functional, I can make it more dynamic by adding things like the ability to post comments.  This will make use of some client side Javascript and server side Python.  The comments can also be stored in a database, so I will also need to learn how to manage databases.  I think I will use mySQL.</p>
