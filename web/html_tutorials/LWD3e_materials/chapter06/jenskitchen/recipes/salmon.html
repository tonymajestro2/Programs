I've already shared this popular recipe with many of my friends. The best thing is it's so easy to make!</p></blockquote><ul>  <li>1/4 c. dry sherry</li>  <li>2 T. soy sauce</li>  <li>2 T. vegetable oil</li>  <li>2 t. dry mustard</li>  <li>3-4 T. freshly minced garlic</li>  <li>1 to 2 lbs salmon filets</li></ul><ol>  <li>Mix together first 5 ingredients in a shallow dish. Place the cleaned and de-boned salmon filets face down in the mixture and allow to marinate for 1/2 to 1 hour. (Tip, I cut a large piece of salmon into the serving sizes before marinating so the marinade can coat the sides of each piece as well.)</li>  <li>Preheat the broiler. Transfer filets to a baking sheet, skin-down. Broil the salmon on the top rack for 7 to 9 minutes, or until done to your liking (I like it still pink in the center).</li>  <li>I usually serve this with an aromatic rice and a lightly seasoned stir fry.</li></ol>
