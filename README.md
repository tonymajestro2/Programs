To build, run 'make' in the book directory.
You need to have Pygment installed. On a Ubuntu machine, that's in python-pygments.

To contribute, fork on github (using a private micro account from https://github.com/edu ),
then clone your fork, commit and push your contributions, then issue a pull request.
